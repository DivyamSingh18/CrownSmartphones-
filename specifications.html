		<font size="5" color="white"> The new ultrawide camera is just brilliant for travel photography, landmarks and spectacular interiors, and while it can't quite match the edge to edge image quality of the other lenses, it still produces sharp, distortion-free ultra-wide images that widen your horizons in every possible way. </font>

		<font size="5" > selfie camera underneath the display so you don’t have a notch or popup selfie camera. Having a completely bezelless phone would look cool but honestly is not practical as having a little bit of space would be necessary and more ergonomic when using the phone.. especially if the screen is large. Right now, we’re seeing Chinese brand phones with a motorized popup selfie camera which actually makes the display more immersive without any notches like on Apple or Samsung. Curved screens are out of style and isn’t “cool” anymore and it is more annoying than a flat screen.</font>
