	<font size="4" color="brown">The One was launched in 2021. At the front, the One sports a 6.41-inch Optic AMOLED display with full HD+ resolution. The AMOLED panel has good viewing angles and has multiple display modes to choose from. One has opted for a dewdrop notch on the 7 which houses a 16-megapixel selfie camera. The One has Corning Gorilla Glass protection at the front and the back which should help it resist scratches.

 

Powering the phone is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC that is capable of running every game out there. There are two variants of the One, 6GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage. We had the 8GB RAM variant for review and it managed to score high in all our benchmark tests. It was snappy for day-to-day performance but could also handle heavy games easily.

The One packs in a 3700mAh battery and is able to deliver all-day battery life. The company supplies a 20W charger with the phone and it is capable of topping the battery up completely in an hour.

One has opted for a dual camera setup on the phone consisting of a 48-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The camera performance was slightly increased and the camera was great in low-light conditions. On the software front, the phone runs on Oxygen OS 9.5 on top of Android 9.0 Pie. There are useful software additions on top that are very useful.

The One will compete with the Asus ZenFone 6 and the Redmi K20 Pro.
